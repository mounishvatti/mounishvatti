## Hey there! 👋

I’m Mounish, a Computer Science student and Software Intern at Bosch, where I’m busy turning ideas into code (and sometimes breaking things, but hey, that’s part of the process, right?).

I believe that “To believe is to become,” and that keeps me pushing myself to turn every crazy idea into reality. So, if you’re looking for someone who can code, learn from mistakes (with a good sense of humor), and bring fresh ideas to the table, you’re in the right place! 🚀
